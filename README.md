    ui.toggle_power_warning(power_ratio() == 0)
    update_capacitor_levels()
```

#### Mission Generation
Dynamic mission system with procedural objectives:
```gdscript
func generate_missions():
    current_mission = mission_template.duplicate()
    current_mission.generate_mission(level_manager, random_position)
    current_mission.on_completed.connect(on_mission_completed)
```
