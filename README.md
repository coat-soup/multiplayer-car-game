# Voidburn
Voidburn is an online co-op, multiplayer game where you crew a space carrier with your friends, fighting off enemies, exploring the nebula, and frantically repairing your onboard systems to make sure nothing explodes.
The project is currently in closed-alpha testing on steam, with plans to open it to a wider audience soon.

You can follow development on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@coatsoup) or check out the intermittent (very janky) test builds on [github](https://github.com/coat-soup/multiplayer-car-game/releases).
